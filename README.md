# 💼 AI-Based Fraud Detection System

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms. It leverages real-world financial transaction datasets to train models that can classify activities as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**, helping businesses and institutions combat digital financial fraud.

---

## 📘 Overview

- Detect anomalies or fraudulent activities in transactional data
- Leverage supervised machine learning techniques
- Handle class imbalance (as fraud is rare)
- Use data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation
- Provide performance visualization (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and preprocess large-scale transactional data
- Handle imbalanced classes using oversampling/undersampling
- Train multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Support Vector Machine
- Evaluate model performance with:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Visualize fraud patterns and feature importance

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree & Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Optional: Neural Networks (for deep learning enhancements)

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall correctness

Precision: Correctly predicted frauds among all predicted frauds

Recall: Correctly predicted frauds among all actual frauds

F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall

ROC AUC: Ability of the model to distinguish between classes

📦 Handling Imbalanced Data
Because fraud is rare, we use:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

Undersampling the majority class

Class weights in certain algorithms (like Logistic Regression, SVM)

🖼️ Visualizations
Fraud distribution bar plots

Feature correlation heatmaps

Confusion matrix

Precision-Recall and ROC curves
